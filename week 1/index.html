        <div class="block">
          <p>
            Hi I'm Roguin P. Espinal, about three years ago I started to go deep
            into web development, through those years I was able to form a solid
            base of practical knowledge that has allowed me to continue
            advancing in this path of creating digital products. I am a fan of
            innovation and thinking of new ways to make products more efficient
            through my knowledge. In my free time I like to spend time with my
            family, go to the gym or just enjoy a good walk.

            The Dominican Republic, a democratic nation with a population of
            more than 10 million people, has a territory that extends to 48,442
            square kilometers. A little more than twice the size of New Jersey
            and roughly the same size as Costa Rica. Its coveted shores are fed
            It is the first Spanish settlement in the Americas, or the New
            World, thanks to the arrival of Christopher Columbus during his
            first voyage in 1492. Aside from choosing the Dominican Republic as
            their only home in the region, a land blessed with fertile soil and
            gold deposits, Columbus and the Spanish crown used the country as a
            launching pad for their conquests around the Caribbean and the
            United States. Today, Santo Domingo, the first city in the Americas,
            serves as the capital of the Dominican Republic, and continues to
            thrive while preserving its original Spanish history and
            architecture.
